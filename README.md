# testNewRepo
this is new branch under the new repo 
how to create new branch in existing repo
first of all you need to create new folder in local
open that folder in editor and you will see bydefault
main branch or master branch is checkout
now create a local branch using following command

git branch yourBranchName

after that checkout this newly created branch 
and create files and folders or you may leave it 
empty because you want to create empty branch
this is because if you have more the two branches
and you donot want to copy all data of the branches
in this newly created branch so that is way we are
creating empty branch using master or main branch
after add files and folders in your branch the next
command is to add in git given below

git push -u origin yourBranchName

this will create a new branch in the git only with
the files and folders that you added
